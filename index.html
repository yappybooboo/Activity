            Mother Earth has been talking to us ever since her beginning.<br>
            She smiles through sunshine, cries through rainfall and screams through storms.<br>
            And now, more than ever, paying attention to the many moods of the earth is crucial,<br>
            as we face climate change and detrimental weather events that place people at risk.<br>
            Life as we know it depends on the health of the planet, and that’s why Earth Day,<br>
            which falls on April 22, is so important.
